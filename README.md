# merger_trace

This repository contains the analysis code used in the paper:  
**Kong & Dell'Antonio (2025), Merger-Induced Disturbance and Temporal Signatures in Galaxy Clusters**, submitted to A&A, arXiv:2509.20637.

The project builds a disturbance score from halo phase-space information, star formation rate (SFR) curvature, and photometric features. It is used to identify and characterize merger activity in cosmological simulations (TNG-Cluster) and survey data (LoVoCCS).

### Repository structure:
- `data/`: Data specifications used in this project  
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data generation and analysis
