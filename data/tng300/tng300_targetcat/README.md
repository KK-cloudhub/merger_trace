This directory is used to store **sorted group catalogs** from the **TNG300-1** simulation.

The data in this folder are used in our project for:

- Storing **halo-level information** for selected halos,  
  which are used for generating aperture mass maps.  
  These group catalogs help identify and extract the corresponding halo snapshots.

All raw data products belong to the IllustrisTNG collaboration and are publicly available. Please refer to the following papers when using these data:
