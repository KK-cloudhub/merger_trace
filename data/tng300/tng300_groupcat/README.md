This directory is used to store the group catalog files downloaded from the [IllustrisTNG project](https://www.tng-project.org/data/) – specifically from the TNG300-1 simulation.

The data in this folder are used in our project for:

- Selecting target halos with masses above 10^13 solar masses  
- Extracting halo-level properties such as mass and radius

All raw data products belong to the IllustrisTNG collaboration and are publicly available. Please refer to the following papers when using these data:
