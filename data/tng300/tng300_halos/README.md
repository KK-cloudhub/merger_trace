This directory stores the **particle-level data** for selected halos from the TNG300-1 simulation.

These data are used in our project for:
- Generating **mock aperture mass maps** for weak lensing analysis.

We include a sample snapshot file for **FOF halo 142** as an example.  
You can visualize it using the plotting scripts in `./notebook/plot`.

All raw data products belong to the IllustrisTNG collaboration and are publicly available.  Please cite the following papers when using these data:
