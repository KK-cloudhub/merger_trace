This directory is used to store the mock aperture mass maps with and without noise for targets in TNG300-1.

The data in this folder are used in our project for:
- Estimating the mass ratios of target clusters based on aperture mass maps

We also save the true mass ratio values for target FOF halos, extracted from the TNG300-1 group catalogs in `halo_mass_ratios.csv`.

We only provide an example for FOF halo 142, which can be plotted using the scripts in `notebook/plot/`.
