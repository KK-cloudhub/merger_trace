This directory stores the data used for evaluating the mass ratio estimator, i.e., the peak separations and true mass ratios for selected halos in TNG300-1.

The data are derived from generated mock aperture mass maps and are used in our project for:

- Evaluating the correlation between the true mass ratios and our derived peak-based estimators from mock aperture mass maps.
