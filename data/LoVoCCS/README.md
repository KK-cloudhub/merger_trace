This directory is used to store data from LoVoCCS clusters.  
It serves as the default path for the analysis codes in this repository.

The data in this folder are used in our project for:
- Analyzing aperture mass maps, identifying peaks, and measuring their relative intensities
- Fitting the masses of the central subhalo and massive satellite galaxy located at the peak positions via weak gravitational lensing
- Performing case studies with the u- and g-band fluxes

We also include basic information from NASA/IPAC NED for clusters matched with eROSITA,  
which are documented in `cluster_redshift_info.csv`.

Note: This repository does **not** include any raw LoVoCCS data.  
All raw data products belong to the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS) and are **not** publicly available.  
This folder only provides a placeholder path and documentation of the data sources used in our analysis.
