This directory is used to store the main and morphology catalogs from eROSITA.  

The data in this folder are used in our project for:
- Matching the morphology catalogs and main catalogs of eROSITA to obtain cluster information
- Matching with LoVoCCS, deriving disturbance scores from morphology catalogs for matched LoVoCCS clusters

Please go to the [eROSITA website](https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/dr1/AllSkySurveyData_dr1/Catalogues_dr1/
) to get these two catalogs.

Note: This repository does **not** include the raw eROSITA data.  
This folder only provides a placeholder path and documentation of the data sources used in our analysis.

Please refer to these two papers describing the catalogs:
