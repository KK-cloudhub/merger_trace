This directory is used to store the cutout files of FOF halos downloaded from the [IllustrisTNG project](https://www.tng-project.org/data/) — specifically from the TNG-Cluster simulation.

Note: we only download the cutout data of gas particles (PartType0) and black holes (PartType5), which are separately stored in the two folders: `tng_cluster_cutouts_gas` and `tng_cluster_cutouts_bh`.

The data in this folder are used in our project for:

- Extracting particle-level information for the primary zoom-in targets of TNG-Cluster  
- Generating mock X-ray images and calculating the BCG offsets

All raw data products belong to the TNG-Cluster collaboration and are publicly available. Please refer to the following papers when using these data:

- [Nelson et al. (2019a)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05609)  
- [Nelson et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06338)
