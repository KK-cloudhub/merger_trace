# TNG-Cluster X-ray Mock Image Data

This directory is used to store X-ray mock files of 352 primary zoom-in targets in TNG-Cluster at redshift 0.2 (snapshot 84), along three projections generated in our project.

## Usage

The data in this folder are used in our project for:

- Calculating BCG offsets
